<b>Sept. 13, 2005 - Development status update :</b><ul>
<fieldset>
<OL>
 <LI>
In CVS presently we now have support for .desktop files provided by GNOME, KDE and some other apps,
which should simplify menu configuration greately. Just add line like : <br>
Category "KDE:Applications"
</br>
to any .include file and all KDE apps that are part of category Applications will get automatically picked up,
along with its icons, etc. <br>
There is a new utility PrintDesktopEntries that will print all available categories with entries on your system.
WE now need to stick as much as possible of that stuff into the default menu in distro.
	</LI>
	<LI>Presently working on making Stop Module menu being autogenerated based on what modules are actually running.
	</LI>
	<LI>Will add new autogenerated menu for restarting modules next.</LI>
	<LI>GUI tool for manageing layout of the desktop - which modules are started and with what geometries, will be a natural progression from here.</LI>
	<LI>Still working on some placement fixes, such as GIMP not going to proper viewport and XINERAMA placement (fabs).</LI> 
	<LI>More doc updates by born2late.</LI>
