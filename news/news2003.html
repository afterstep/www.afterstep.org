This release fixes numerous bugs and cleans up build system. In addition new WinTabs module had been added,
althou it still remains undocumented and experimetal, but in future it will allow combining similar applications,
such as text editors, terms, etc, into single window with tabs.
<br>
Presently extensive work is under way on aterm - the AfterStep Terminal Emulator, and it should be 
updated and included with AfterStep distribution in next release. Also under way is work on ASCP, and should see the light of day soon.
<br>
Documentation is in dire need of being cleaned up and updated, and the plan right now is to convert it all into 
DocBook XML. Anybody willing to help - let me know.
