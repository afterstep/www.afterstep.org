It appears there's yet another ftpd exploit so ftp.afterstep.org will be going
 down until the exploit is fixed. At this time, the box will also go through a
 rebuild process, so be prepared for some bugs. :)<br>

Some terrific and exciting news! Sasha has created our very own image processing
 library, which is the <b>"Fastest image blending, rendering and manipulation
 library for X"</b>! It's going to be released as a standalone library, along with
 being integrated into AfterStep proper (cvs). He's got a website up, so everyone
 take a look and try to prove him wrong about it being the "fastest" - NOT! :)<br>

As a teaser - we are about to announce a new default theme/look contest for
 AfterStep; yes, that's right, the look that you see right when you start AfterStep
 for the first time. It's not as easy as it sounds however, it needs to work for
 8bpp colordepth. Sure you can make the images use more colors for the larger
 depths; but they all have to be the same overall look.<br>

 On the legal front, NeXT's attorney has been very gracious in his dealings with me and has allowed us a period of approximately one month to eliminate the NEXSTEP trademark icons. So, the screenshots are back up for the time being, but I would still like to have those replaced within the week. Let's put those artistic hats on! ;^)<br>

 I have been notified that NeXT Software, Inc. would prefer we not use icons that resemble NEXTSTEP's icons. If you notice any broken images on this homepage, it is because I have decided to remove an image that contains such an icon. Until we create newer and better looking replacement icons to represent our applications, the page will stay this way. If you have an icon you feel would nicely suit AfterStep, please upload it to ftp://oak.sfasu.edu/incoming and we will decide from there what to use with the default distribution which now lacks many critical icons. Thanks!<br>
