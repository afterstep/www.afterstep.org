			<font size=2> is a generic image manipulation library.
			It was initially implemented to address <A href="http://www.afterstep.org">AfterStep Window Manager</A>'s needs for
			image handling, but it evolved into extremely powerful and flexible software, suitable for virtually any project
			that has needs for loading, manipulating, displaying images, as well as writing images in files. Most of the popular
			image formats are supported using standard libraries, with <A href="http://www.gimp.org">XCF</A>, XPM, PPM/PNM,

			antialiasing of standard fonts from <A href="http://www.xfree86.org">X window system</A>. <p>
			Primary design goals of libAfterImage are memory efficiency and <A href="ss_sub3.php">superior image quality</A>.<p>
